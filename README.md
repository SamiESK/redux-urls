Completion of Ringy ShortURL challenge. 

Implemented in React Native framework with a redux-saga application side effects to handle 
POST requests through https://shrtco.de/docs/?ref=public-apis public api using redux to handle these operations.

To run this web application, simply access the redux-url directory and run 'npm i', then 'npm start'

Task Description:

    "Your task is to create a React webapp using redux and sagas to shorten URLs. (Sort of like https://cleanuri.com)

    You can use https://shrtco.de/docs/?ref=public-apis to make a request to a url shortener service.

    If your api requests fail, you are welcome to use any url shortener api, or even a mock API such as https://mockapi.io

    Or you can return mock data without actually hitting an API."
